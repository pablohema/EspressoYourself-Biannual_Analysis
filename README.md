## Project Background
Espresso Yourself is an energetic coffee shop franchise that opened its doors this year. They aim to change the coffee game with top-notch brews.

To boost their performance and grow their market presence, Espresso Yourself has teamed up with us to dive into their sales data and uncover actionable insights. This collaboration is led by their COO, who is keen on using data-driven strategies to improve business operations.

## Executive Summary
Espresso Yourself's analysis of 149k records across first half of 2023 shows sales with value of 702,000$ with each of three stores contributing at 33% of sales.

The Coffee and Tea categories are essential to this business, accounting for an impressive 67% of total revenue. This highlights the significant impact these products have on the company's financial performance, reflecting their strong demand and crucial role in driving overall sales and growth.

Expanding the top category product lines, creating bundle offers and launching a customer loyalty program can significantly enhance the performance of all three stores. Additionally, marketing campaigns on social networks and utilizing glass storefront displays will boost visibility and engagement. This strategy aims to drive customer retention and growth, thereby strengthening the market position and ensuring sustainable success for the business.

- All three stores exhibit seasonality, with sales peaking in June and July, aligning with the summer vacation period.
- The operational strategy for balancing store performance has been successfully implemented, ensuring an equal sales split among the three stores.

### Stores Activity
- Focus operations and staffing during the morning (7:00 AM - 10:00 PM) and early across all stores, as these are consistently the busiest period.
- Sales drop significantly after morning peak-hour in all stores. Consider reducing evening operational hours to save costs and reallocate resources to peak times. tore 5 should close one hour earlier in the evening, as sales drop significantly during this time. Transfer this operative hour to Store 3, which maintains an average of 2,500 sales per hour during late operating hours.
- Store 3 underperforms across all peak-hour time slots. Investigate local market conditions and implement targeted promotions or menu adjustments to boost activity.
- Saturdays and Sundays maintain sales levels comparable to weekdays, highlighting the strategic location of stores near businesses and industries operating 7 days a week, ensuring steady customer traffic throughout the week.

### Unexpected Growth or Metric
- The decline and subsequent flattening of sales observed at the end of January were attributed to logistical issues from our beverage supplier.
- Coffee and tea remain our top-performing categories, demonstrating very rapid sales growth, as previously noted.
- Both bakery items and drinking chocolate show a gradual and steady increase in sales. However, bakery sales exhibit seasonal peaks around the middle of each month. An agreement with a sales agency has been reached to address seasonality readings by Q4 2023.

_TOP 15 - Unit price_
- Coffee beans continue to grow steadily, with noticeable peaks in sales mid-month. This pattern is due to the volume sold typically representing a one-month supply. It is also worth noting that nine of the ten most expensive products are coffee beans, reflecting their premium pricing.

## Recommendations

### Customer Growth and Retention
- **Boost Repeat Purchases:** Focus on customers who have made only one purchase with personalized re-engagement campaigns. Introduce tiered rewards within the loyalty program to encourage frequent visits and improve customer retention.
- **Customer Acquisition:** Create acquisition channels by using social media, partnering with influencers and starting affiliate programs. Improve the coffee shop's messaging to re-engage former customers and attract new ones.
- **Leverage Core Customer Insights:** Analyze the behaviors and preferences of regular customers to enhance loyalty campaigns. Introduce referral incentives to encourage promotion and increase new customer acquisition through existing customers.

***

### Customer Rewards Program
- **Improve Loyalty First Visit:** Launch targeted onboarding campaigns that offer first-purchase discounts or early access to new products. Use tiered rewards to encourage frequent visits and build stronger customer loyalty.
- **Data-Driven Metrics:** Continuously monitor loyalty metrics to refine program offerings based on data, ensuring sustained engagement and effectiveness.
- **Feedback Incentives:** Encourage members to provide feedback by offering rewards or points for completing surveys.

***

### Optimized Media Strategies
- **Enhance Email Marketing Campaigns:** Personalize email marketing campaigns with tailored offers and updates. This will improve customer engagement and encourage repeat purchases.
- **Improve Mobile App Experience:** Create a mobile appâ€™s checkout process and personalization features to leverage the growing trend of mobile usage, aiming to boost its share of total sales.
- **Optimize Social Media Engagement:** Strengthen social media presence by creating interactive content and engaging with customers regularly. This will help build a loyal community and drive more traffic to your coffee shop.
- **Broaden Affiliate Partnerships:** Expand affiliate partnerships and offer higher commissions to attract influential marketers. This will help enhance brand visibility and increase the average order value (AOV).

***

### Store Expansion Plans
- **Identify Key Markets:** Conduct market research to find high-potential areas for new stores by examining demographics, economic data, and consumer preferences.
- **Brand Presence:** Focus on regions with strong brand recognition, using targeted marketing and local events to deepen customer loyalty and visibility.
- **Local Partnerships:** Start partnerships with local businesses, suppliers, and community organizations to create mutually beneficial relationships.

***

### Enhancing Product Offer
- **Bundles in Loyalty Program:** Develop appealing product bundles that include popular branded items as part of the loyalty program. These bundles can be tailored to customer preferences, providing added value and deeper engagement with the brand.
- **Off-Peak Product Offer:** Implement promotions on seasonal products during off-peak periods to maintain steady sales year-round. This approach helps clear inventory and attract customers.
- **Low-Selling Categories:** Identify bottom categories with consistently low sales and plan their discontinuation. Redirect resources to more profitable and in-demand products to maximize overall revenue.
- **Midday Boost Sales:** Develop lunch specials and combo deals for the working crowd. Promote these offers to attract office workers and increase foot traffic during typically slower periods.

## Questions and Assumptions for Stakeholders Prior to Project Advancement
- Non-Sequential ids for `store_id` and `product_id`.
  - Is there any indication of missing or corrupted data? Identifying and addressing these gaps is critical to ensure data reliability.
  - If data has been deleted, it's essential to understand the reason. This could cause long-term issues. A recommended solution is to assign new IDs to maintain consistency and avoid disruptions.
- `transactions` table has not been optimized for OLTP use.
  - Proposal to implement an OLAP database (`Transaction`) to enhance analytical performance and deliver more accurate insights for the company's analysis.

- The data provided for this analysis is inadequate, as the `transaction_id` pertains to individual products rather than entire orders. Do you realise this will create non realistic AOV values?
    - A new field, `order_id`, needs to be added to collect all products ordered by a customer in a single transaction.
    - Similar to `customer_id`, where 0 indicates an unregistered customer, any other number will denote a registered individual.
